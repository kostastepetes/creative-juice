  public."Locations" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    name text null,
    description text null,
    contact_info text null,
    address text null,
    "imageUrl" text null,
    city text null,
    type text null,
    approved boolean null default false,
    constraint Locations_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

**Coffee Requests:**

```sql
create table
  public."Coffee Requests" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    message text null,
    sender text null,
    receiver text null,
    location text null,
    constraint Coffee Requests_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

**Chat:**

```sql
create table
  public."Chats" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    timestamp timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    message text null,
    sender text null,
    recipient text null,
    read boolean null,
    constraint Chats_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

**Waitlist:**

  public."Waitlist" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    name text null,
    email text null,
    city text null,
    constraint Waitlist_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

**supabase.js:**

The provided code is initializing a Supabase client, which is used to interact with a Supabase project.

`import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)`

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'`: This line imports theÂ `createClient`Â function from theÂ `@supabase/supabase-js`Â package. This function is used to create a new Supabase client.

1. `const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: This line retrieves the Supabase URL from the environment variables (the .env file of the project). This URL is specific to your Supabase project and is used to connect to your database.

1. `const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: This line retrieves the Supabase anonymous key from the environment variables (the .env file of the project). This key is also specific to your Supabase project and is used to authenticate requests.

1. `export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)`: This line creates a new Supabase client using the previously retrieved Supabase URL and anonymous key. TheÂ `createClient`Â function returns a client object that provides methods to interact with your Supabase project, such as querying your database or managing user authentication.

This code is typically placed in a separate module that is imported wherever a Supabase client is needed. This allows the same Supabase client to be used across different parts of your application, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Project Init:

1. **Create a new Vue project with Vite**

`Use the following command to create a new Vue project with Vite:`

    `npm create vite@latest creative-juice --template vue`

You will be prompted to pick a preset. You can choose to create the project with TypeScript, Vue Router.

2. **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies**

`Change to the newly created project directory and install the necessary dependencies:`

    `cd creative-juice
     npm install`

Then, start the development server:

    `npm run dev`

3. **Install Supabase**

`Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. To install Supabase in your project, use the following command:`

    `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`

4. **Install Bootstrap**

`Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that can be used to build responsive layouts. Install Bootstrap in your project using the following command:`

    `npm install bootstrap`

After installing Bootstrap, you need to import it in your main.js file:

    `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'`

## Git Init:

### Create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# creativejuice" >> README.md
  git init
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "first commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/kostastepetes/creativejuice.git
  git push -u origin main
```

### â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/kostastepetes/creativejuice.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

# Frontend:

The frontend is made with Vue 3 + Boostrap 5 + GSAP and communicates with the Supabase backend.

**App.vue:**

The App.vue of the project is a Vue.js component that uses the Supabase library for user authentication. It sets up a session and listens for changes in the authentication state.

Let's break it down:

`<script setup>
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'
import { supabase } from './supabase'

const session = ref()`

In the above code, theÂ `onMounted`Â andÂ `ref`Â functions are imported from Vue.js. TheÂ `onMounted`Â function is a lifecycle hook that runs after the component is mounted, andÂ `ref`Â is used to create reactive references. TheÂ `supabase`Â object is imported from a local file. AÂ `session`Â reference is created, which will hold the current session data.

`onMounted(() => {
 supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data }) => {
   session.value = data.session
 })

 supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_, _session) => {
   session.value = _session
 })
})
</script>`

In theÂ `onMounted`Â function, two operations are performed:

1. `supabase.auth.getSession()`Â is called to get the current session. The returned session data is assigned toÂ `session.value`.
2. `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`Â is used to listen for changes in the authentication state. Whenever the authentication state changes (e.g., a user logs in or out), the new session data is assigned toÂ `session.value`.

`<template>
 <div>
   <router-view v-if="session" :session="session" />
   <router-view v-else />
 </div>
</template>`

In the template, twoÂ `router-view`Â components are used. The first one is only rendered ifÂ `session`Â is truthy (i.e., a user is logged in), and it receives the currentÂ `session`Â as a prop. The secondÂ `router-view`Â is rendered ifÂ `session`Â is falsy (i.e., no user is logged in) and does not receive any props.

This code is a common pattern for handling user authentication in a Vue.js application using Supabase. The session data is used to control the visibility and behavior of certain parts of the application based on the user's authentication status

**main.js:**

The main.js file is a Vue.js application setup file. It imports various dependencies, sets up routing, and initializes the Vue application.

Let's break it down:

`import { createApp } from 'vue'
import './style.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import 'bootstrap'
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import Account from './views/Account.vue'
import Auth from './views/Auth.vue'
import Homepage from './views/Homepage.vue'
import About from './views/About.vue'
import Profile from './views/Profile.vue'
import Community from './views/Community.vue'
import Discover from './views/Discover.vue'
import SubmitLocation from './views/SubmitLocation.vue'
import Chat from './components/Chat.vue'
import CoffeeRequest from './components/CoffeeRequest.vue'
import Waitlist from './components/Waitlist.vue'
import App from './App.vue'`

In the above code, several Vue.js components are imported. These components are used to build the application's user interface. TheÂ `createApp`Â function is imported from Vue.js to create the application instance. TheÂ `createRouter`Â andÂ `createWebHistory`Â functions are imported fromÂ `vue-router`Â to set up routing. TheÂ `style.css`Â andÂ `bootstrap.min.css`Â files are imported for styling. TheÂ `App.vue`Â file is the root component of the application.

`import { library, dom } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome";
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { fab } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons';
import { far } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons';
library.add(fas, far, fab)`

This code imports the Font Awesome library and adds the solid, regular, and brand icons to the library. TheÂ `FontAwesomeIcon`Â component is imported to use the icons in the Vue.js components.

`const routes = [
   { path: '/account', component: Account },
   { path: '/auth', component: Auth },
   { path: '/about', component: About },
   { path: '/:username', component: Profile },
   { path: '/community', component: Community},
   { path: '/discover', component: Discover},
   { path: '/submit-location', component: SubmitLocation},
   { path: '/chat/:username', component: Chat, name: 'Chat' },
   { path: '/coffee-request', component: CoffeeRequest, name: 'CoffeeRequest' },
   { path: '/waitlist', component: Waitlist, name: 'Waitlist' },
   { path: '/', component: Homepage }
]

const router = createRouter({
 history: createWebHistory(),
 routes
})`

In this part, the application's routes are defined in an array. Each route is an object that maps a URL path to a Vue.js component. TheÂ `createRouter`Â function is used to create a router instance with the defined routes and theÂ `createWebHistory`Â function for history mode.
`const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router)
app.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
app.mount('#app')`

Finally, the Vue.js application is created with the root componentÂ `App.vue`. The router is added to the application withÂ `app.use(router)`, and theÂ `FontAwesomeIcon`Â component is globally registered withÂ `app.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)`. The application is then mounted to a DOM element with the idÂ `app`

### Components:

**Section.vue**:

The provided code is a Vue.js component that uses the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) to animate elements on the page.

In the template, a Bootstrap-styled layout is defined. The layout consists of two columns. The first column contains a header, subheader, and a call-to-action button. The second column contains an image. TheÂ `ref`Â attribute is used to create references to these columns. These references are used to animate the columns using GSAP.

`<script>
import { onMounted, ref, nextTick } from "vue";
import { gsap } from "gsap";

export default {
 name: 'Section',
 props: ['headerText', 'subheaderText', 'ctaText'],
 setup() {
   const col1 = ref(null);
   const col2 = ref(null);

   onMounted(async () => {
     await nextTick(); // wait for the next DOM update cycle

     gsap.from(col1.value, { x: "-100%", duration: 1 });
     gsap.from(col2.value, { x: "100%", duration: 1 });
   });

   return { col1, col2 };
 },
};
</script>`

In the script, theÂ `onMounted`Â andÂ `ref`Â functions are imported from Vue.js. TheÂ `gsap`Â object is imported from theÂ `gsap`Â package. TheÂ `onMounted`Â function is a lifecycle hook that runs after the component is mounted. TheÂ `ref`Â function is used to create reactive references.

In theÂ `setup`Â function, twoÂ `ref`Â references are created for the two columns. TheÂ `onMounted`Â function is used to animate the columns when the component is mounted. TheÂ `gsap.from`Â function is used to animate the columns. TheÂ `col1`Â column is animated to slide in from the left, and theÂ `col2`Â column is animated to slide in from the right

**Infobar.vue:**

The Infobar.vue is a Vue.js component that displays different content based on theÂ `session`Â prop.

In the template, twoÂ `div`Â elements are defined. The firstÂ `div`Â is rendered if theÂ `session`Â prop is truthy (i.e., a user is logged in). The secondÂ `div`Â is rendered if theÂ `session`Â prop is falsy (i.e., no user is logged in). The secondÂ `div`Â contains a paragraph and a button. The paragraph displays theÂ `infoText`Â prop, and the button displays theÂ `ctaText`Â prop and links to the URL specified by theÂ `url`Â prop

`<script>
export default {
 name: 'InfoBar',
 props: ['session', 'infoText', 'ctaText', 'url']
}
</script>`

In the script, theÂ `InfoBar`Â component is defined. The component accepts four props:Â `session`,Â `infoText`,Â `ctaText`, andÂ `url`. TheÂ `session`Â prop is used to determine whether to display the first or secondÂ `div`Â in the template. TheÂ `infoText`,Â `ctaText`, andÂ `url`Â props are used to customize the content of the secondÂ `div`

**Info.vue:**

The Info.vue is a Vue.js component that displays three sections of information.

In the template, three sections of information are defined. Each section consists of an image and a text block. The image and text block are arranged in a row using Bootstrap's grid system. The text block contains a header and a paragraph. The header and paragraph are centered vertically in the text block.

`<script>
import { onMounted, ref } from "vue";

export default {
 name: 'Info'
};
</script>`

In the script, theÂ `Info`Â component is defined. TheÂ `onMounted`Â andÂ `ref`Â functions are imported from Vue.js, but they are not used in this component. TheÂ `name`Â property is set to 'Info'

**Navbar.vue:**

The Navbar.vue is a Vue.js component that represents a navigation bar. The navigation bar includes links to various pages and a sign-out button that is only visible when a user is logged in.



In the template, a Bootstrap-styled navigation bar is defined. The navigation bar includes a logo, a button for toggling the navigation links on smaller screens, and a list of navigation links. The list includes links to the 'Community', 'Discover', and 'About' pages. There are also links to the user's profile and account pages, and a sign-out button. The sign-out button and the user-specific links are only displayed when a user is logged in, as determined by theÂ `session`Â prop.

The script does the following:

1. Imports necessary functions from Vue and other packages. TheÂ `ref`,Â `watch`,Â `toRefs`,Â `useRouter`, andÂ `defineProps`Â functions are imported from Vue.js. TheÂ `supabase`Â object is imported from theÂ `supabase`Â package.
2. Defines theÂ `session`Â prop usingÂ `defineProps()`. This prop is expected to be passed from a parent component and is used to determine whether a user is logged in.
3. Converts theÂ `session`Â prop to a reactive reference usingÂ `toRefs()`.
4. Defines aÂ `username`Â ref that will be used to store the username of the logged-in user.
5. Uses theÂ `watch()`Â function to observe changes in theÂ `session`Â prop. When theÂ `session`Â prop changes, it fetches the username of the user from a 'Profiles' table in a Supabase database and assigns it to theÂ `username`Â ref.
6. Creates aÂ `router`Â object usingÂ `useRouter()`. This object is used to navigate to different routes.
7. Defines aÂ `signOut`Â function that signs out the user and navigates to the 'auth' page.
8. Exposes theÂ `username`Â andÂ `signOut`Â refs to the template usingÂ `defineExpose()`. This allows these refs to be accessed in the template

**Footer.vue:**

The footer is styled using Bootstrap classes likeÂ `d-flex`,Â `flex-wrap`,Â `justify-content-between`,Â `align-items-center`,Â `py-4`,Â `my-4`,Â `border-top`,Â `col-md-4`,Â `ms-3`,Â `list-unstyled`, andÂ `d-flex`. These classes are used for layout and styling purposes.

TheÂ `font-awesome-icon`Â component is used to display social media icons. TheÂ `:icon`Â attribute is a shorthand forÂ `v-bind:icon`, which is a directive used to reactively update an HTML attribute. In this case, it binds theÂ `icon`Â attribute to an array of stringsÂ `['fab', 'linkedin']`Â andÂ `['fab', 'instagram']` .

The script section contains the JavaScript code for the component. In this case, it's very simple and just contains aÂ `name`Â property for the component. TheÂ `name`Â property is used to identify the component in the Vue.js ecosystem.

**Avatar.vue:**

Props and Emits:

TheÂ `defineProps`Â andÂ `defineEmits`Â functions are used to declare the props and events that the component can accept and emit. In this case, the component acceptsÂ `path`,Â `size`, andÂ `hideUpload`Â as props, and emitsÂ `upload`Â andÂ `update:path`Â events.

Reactivity:

TheÂ `ref`Â function from Vue is used to create reactive references. In this case,Â `uploading`,Â `src`, andÂ `files`Â are reactive references. When their values change, Vue will automatically update the DOM to reflect the changes.

Methods:

TheÂ `downloadImage`Â andÂ `uploadAvatar`Â functions are methods that handle the downloading and uploading of avatar images. They use theÂ `supabase`Â client to interact with a storage bucket named 'avatars'. TheÂ `uploadAvatar`Â method also uses theÂ `emit`Â function to emit theÂ `upload`Â andÂ `update:path`Â events when an image is successfully uploaded.

Watch:

TheÂ `watch`Â function is used to observe changes in theÂ `path`Â prop. WhenÂ `path`Â changes, theÂ `downloadImage`Â function is called to download the new avatar image.

The template section defines the HTML structure of the component. It displays an avatar image ifÂ `src`Â is truthy, and a placeholder div otherwise. It also provides an upload button that triggers theÂ `uploadAvatar`Â method when a file is selected. The button's text changes based on whether an upload is in progress

**BackgroundImage.vue:**

Props and Emits:

TheÂ `defineProps`Â andÂ `defineEmits`Â functions are used to declare the props and events that the component can accept and emit. In this case, the component acceptsÂ `path`,Â `size`, andÂ `hideUpload`Â as props, and emitsÂ `upload`Â andÂ `update:path`Â events.

Reactivity:

TheÂ `ref`Â function from Vue is used to create reactive references. In this case,Â `uploading`,Â `src`, andÂ `files`Â are reactive references. When their values change, Vue will automatically update the DOM to reflect the changes.

Methods:

TheÂ `downloadImage`Â andÂ `uploadbackgroundImage`Â functions are methods that handle the downloading and uploading of background images. They use theÂ `supabase`Â client to interact with a storage bucket named 'background_images'. TheÂ `uploadbackgroundImage`Â method also uses theÂ `emit`Â function to emit theÂ `upload`Â andÂ `update:path`Â events when an image is successfully uploaded.

Watch:

TheÂ `watch`Â function is used to observe changes in theÂ `path`Â prop. WhenÂ `path`Â changes, theÂ `downloadImage`Â function is called to download the new background image.

The template section defines the HTML structure of the component. It displays a background image ifÂ `src`Â is truthy, and a placeholder div otherwise. It also provides an upload button that triggers theÂ `uploadbackgroundImage`Â method when a file is selected. The button's text changes based on whether an upload is in progress.
